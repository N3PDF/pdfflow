Building the graph ahead of time
================================

The very first call of PDFFlow compiles the ``tf.Graph``. TensorFlow compiles only functions that are called for the first time. The function ``PDF.trace()`` is intended to build all the necessary parts of the ``tf.Graph`` and prevent future retracings that could slow down the execution.

The ``PDF`` graph can be generated by the following lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

    from pdfflow import mkPDF

    pdf = mkPDF("NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118")
    pdf.trace()
    pdf.alphas_trace()

Note that the strong coupling interpolation requires calling
its own ``PDF.alphas_trace()`` function instead.
